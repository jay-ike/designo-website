## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
  - The `Name`, `Email Address` or `Your Message` fields are empty should show "Can't be empty"
  - The `Email Address` is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"
- **Bonus**: View actual locations on the locations page maps (we recommend [Leaflet JS](https://leafletjs.com/) for this)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) static site generator


### What I learned

we can use more vivid color with oklch colorspace
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: oklch(60% 38% 210);
}

### Continued development

to make this website evolve we can make available offline with serviceworkers

### Useful resources

- [a thorough explanation of oklch color space](https://bottosson.github.io/posts/colorwrong/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how the oklch colorspace work. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
